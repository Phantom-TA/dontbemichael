/**
 * What a ⌘-clicked path token in terminal output should DO.
 *
 * v0.3.4 shipped this for markdown only: `*.md` in agent output became a link
 * that opened the rendered preview. Everything else in the same line stayed
 * dead text, so a printed `src/main/updater.ts` was something you had to
 * retype into the file tree by hand.
 *
 * Three outcomes, and the split is about what we can HONESTLY do with the file:
 *
 *   preview → markdown. There is a renderer for it, and reading is the point.
 *   edit    → source and config we can put in Monaco without lying about it.
 *   reveal  → everything else: images, archives, binaries, PDFs, unknown
 *             extensions, directories. We open the OS file browser at the
 *             file's parent instead of pretending to understand the bytes.
 *
 * WHY REVEAL RATHER THAN OPEN. The token comes from AGENT OUTPUT, which is
 * hostile input. Handing an arbitrary path to the OS "open with default app"
 * call would let a line of terminal text become an execution: a printed
 * `installer.dmg`, `payload.app`, or `.desktop` file is one ⌘-click from
 * running. Revealing only ever opens a file browser, so the worst an agent can
 * do by printing a path is show you a folder you could already reach yourself.
 * That is why this module never returns an "open" verdict for an unknown type.
 *
 * MATCHING IS THE HARD PART, not classifying. Anchoring on a known extension
 * (what the markdown version did) cannot see `report.pdf` — and `report.pdf` is
 * exactly the case that needs reveal. Opening the match up to ANY extension
 * instead drags in every version string and decimal on the line: `v0.4.5`,
 * `1.5`, `electron 43.0`. The rule that separates them is below.
