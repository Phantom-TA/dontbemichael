 * Only Michael assigns work (owner, 2026-09-27: "yes never break this promise.
 * only michael should be the assigner. agent should feel free to check other
 * agents without michael for extra info to do their job. if they still cant
 * then they should tell michael to hand off").
 *
 * The router enforces it, so an agent that ignores its instructions still can't
 * hand a teammate a job: a `request` or `propose` from one team member to
 * another (or to everyone) is delivered to Michael instead, who decides who
 * does it. A `query` and its `inform` answer go straight through, because
 * asking for a fact does not move a job. `done` and `inform` are terminal and
 * pass as well. Nothing here touches messages from Michael, the owner, the
 * scheduler or the app.
 *
 * No electron or node imports: hive.ts calls it, tests load it directly.
