/**
 * The jobs the hire wizard offers, as plain data (docs/designs/hire-redesign.md).
 *
 * A job is a title, the line Michael routes by, and a work style. It comes from
 * one of three places:
 *   - a teammate already in this office (their text as it is today, owner edits
 *     included: design D2),
 *   - a card in any office pack (every business, not just this one: point 4),
 *   - nothing ("Write a new job").
 * Copied text names the person it was written for ("Pam sorts the business
 * inbox"), so the copy swaps that name for the new hire's.
 *
 * Also here: the folder a hire gets (its own, suffixed on a clash: point 2) and
 * the instant, rules-only half of the distinct job check (D6). No electron or
 * node imports: the renderer and main use it, and tests load it directly.
