/**
 * The office break (issue 124) and the stops that share it
 * (docs/designs/office-stopped-account.md): what the owner sees while Claude
 * cannot work. Main keeps the state (src/main/officeBreak.ts); the renderer
 * only shows this view.
 *
 * `reason` is why: `limit` (the Claude plan reached its usage limit; it ends on
 * its own), `credit` (the Anthropic account is out of credit) or `signin` (the
 * login expired, or the API key stopped working). Credit and signin wait on
 * the owner.
 * `until` is when the limit resets, or null when Claude Code did not say (always
 * null for credit and signin).
 * `checking` means the app is waiting for the first finished turn to confirm
 * work can start again: delivery is open then, so that turn can happen.
 * `again` means a check found the same stop still on ("still out").
