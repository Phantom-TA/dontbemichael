/**
 * What the app keeps true about the task board on every fleet tick
 * (docs/designs/card-lifecycle.md section 10). Michael alone writes the board;
 * the app only records and guards it:
 *
 *   - A Done card stays Done. One an agent moves out of Done goes back, status
 *     only, so its questions and history are untouched (ship review, D3).
 *   - A Done card is never lost. One that vanishes from the board is put back
 *     from the copy the app kept when it last saw it Done (D5).
 *   - Triage is a way in, never a way back. A card seen in another status that
 *     turns up in Triage goes back to where it was (D4).
 *   - A parked step wakes on time. At a To do card's nextAt its person gets one
 *     "Next step due" message, and Michael one backstop note when the card is
 *     still in To do hours later (D7).
 *   - A Waiting card comes back. Its check back time (its nextAt, else three
 *     business days) is kept here; when it comes Michael is told once, the card
 *     stays on his gone quiet list while overdue, and after two follow ups he
 *     asks the owner (owner, 2026-10-17, D4 E and D5 B).
 *
 * The state is kept in the app's private folder, so a restart neither forgets
 * a Done card nor sends a reminder twice. No electron / node imports: tests
 * load it directly.
