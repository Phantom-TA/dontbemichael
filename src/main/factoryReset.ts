 * anything else in it: the owner may have picked a folder that holds their own
 * files. roster-backups/ stays too, because a roster is archived on reset,
 * never deleted (roster.ts archive()). The business folder, the Claude Code
 * sign-in and ~/.claude belong to the owner and to Claude Code, not the app.
 *
 * In the app's data folder, config.json is put back to first-run defaults by
 * resetConfig(), and what describes this install rather than the office stays:
 * the updater's log and version stamp, the anonymous usage id, and the hero,
 * model and skill catalog caches.
