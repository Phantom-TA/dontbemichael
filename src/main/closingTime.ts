/**
 * Closing Time — the graceful, data-loss-free shutdown protocol.
 *
 * Killing the PTYs mid-thought loses whatever the agents were holding in
 * working memory: uncommitted WIP, unrecorded decisions, task cards that
 * don't say where the work stands. "Closing time" closes the floor the way a real office
 * does: the human announces it, every worker packs up and confirms, the
 * manager locks the door.
 *
 *   1. The human clicks "closing time" in the quit dialog.
 *   2. We mail the god agent a shutdown brief: broadcast closing time to the
 *      team; every worker commits/parks WIP, then replies with subject
 *      CLOSING-TIME-ACK saying where each of its cards stands (and when a
 *      step is due at a set time). Michael alone moves the cards (ship
 *      review D8); cards carry no running notes (owner, 2026-10-11).
 *   3. The god waits for every ACK (the harness shows live progress by
 *      watching the same inbox traffic), updates board.md, and sends a
 *      message with subject CLOSING-TIME-COMPLETE.
 *   4. The router observer spots that message → the app tears down and quits.
 *
 * While it runs, the dialog lists who is still working, who confirmed and who
 * the owner chose to close without (owner, 2026-09-29). The owner can remind
 * one agent (Michael included) or close without one team member: that agent
 * is no longer waited on, nothing is stopped now, and its terminal ends with
 * every other one at quit, so it is back tomorrow.
 *
 * Everything rides the existing hive rails: inbox delivery, the idle
 * inbox-wake nudge, and Stop-hook draining already guarantee the messages
 * get acted on. This module only injects the kickoff mail and watches the
 * routed traffic — it never types into terminals.
 *
 * Runs in the Electron main process.
