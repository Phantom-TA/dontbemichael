/**
 * Does the office protocol actually REACH the engine on a spawn?
 *
 * The preset registry is only ever checked against itself (engine-readiness.test.cjs
 * reads its own fields), so a preset can be complete on paper and still spawn an
 * agent that was never told what it is. `pi` was exactly that. Its own comment said
 * the protocol arrives positionally, `positionalInitialPrompt` was never set, and
 * `HiveManager.ensureAgent` therefore fell through to a BARE spawn: the bridge,
 * HIVE_SOCK and `canReceiveInbox` were all live, so the router delivered owner mail
 * to an agent that did not know it had a mailbox. That is the same failure
 * `buildCmdCommandLine`'s doc comment describes for the Windows command line, one
 * level up: the agent boots looking healthy and never learns what it is.
 *
 * This drives the consumer instead. Every preset that claims a place in the hive is
 * put through ensureAgent, and the injection it returns has to carry the protocol.
 * The set is DERIVED from the preset (a lifecycle bridge, an inbox, or a resume), so
 * a new engine joins the check the day it is declared, and a preset that claims
 * nothing (kimi, custom) is simply not in it. No exemption list to keep in step
 * with the registry.
 *
 * What this does and does not prove: it pins what the app HANDS the engine, not
 * that the engine reads it. That needs a live CLI with an account, which is what
 * TODOS.md gap 11 (issue #83) waits for. No engine runs here and no call is paid
 * for, so this rides the suite's existing macOS and Windows CI legs unchanged.
